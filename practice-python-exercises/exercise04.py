#OBJ - Create a program that asks the user for a num then prints out a list of all the divisors of that num.

user_num = int(input("Please provide a number: ")) #Ask user for num, turn it into a integer and store in 'user_num'
for n in range(1, user_num +1): #Loop from 1 upto the number given and '+1' so that the number itseld is included 
    if user_num % n == 0: #check if the user num can be divided by 'n'
        print(n) #if it is divisible print 'n'
